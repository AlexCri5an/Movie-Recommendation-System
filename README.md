### Project Description: Movie Recommendation System & Data Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data preprocessing to building a similarity-based movie recommendation system using the IMDb Top 1000 Movies dataset.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transforming, and engineering features from raw data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key insights and trends.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data simplification.
* **Recommendation Engine:** Implementing a basic similarity-based system using Euclidean distance.

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

This project showcases fundamental skills in data handling, exploration, feature engineering, and basic algorithm development for recommendation systems.
